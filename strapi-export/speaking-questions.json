    "promptText": "How can a journalist craft questions that unravel narratives like the one presented here? The key lies in knowing what to ask and from whom. It's crucial to recognize that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. Picture the reporting process as a triangle: one side involves official sources, individuals with titles and expertise who provide the concrete numbers and precise answers to fundamental journalistic inquiries—how much, how many, where, when, and who. On another side, you have overview sources—academics, consultants, and authors—who aren't directly tied as stakeholders but offer a broader perspective on the subject matter. However, the third side of this trifecta—unofficial sources—possesses a unique power: the individual's insight. This is where you uncover the \"why,\" understanding the consequences of an event, trend, phase, or idea on a personal level and what it signifies to those impacted by it. So, how do you discover the valuable information, figuring out what's interesting from what's just talk? You ask unexpected questions. To establish that intricate and delicate human connection, you treat each subject's story with reverence. Recognize that an anecdote is like vital oxygen, breathing life into a narrative of facts and data, infusing it with vibrancy and humanity. Ultimately, it's about valuing and understanding the narratives of each subject, seeking out the profound and impactful stories that resonate at a deeper, soulful level.",
