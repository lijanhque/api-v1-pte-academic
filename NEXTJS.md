# Linking and Navigating
@doc-version: 16.0.1


In Next.js, routes are rendered on the server by default. This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. Next.js comes with built-in [prefetching](#prefetching), [streaming](#streaming), and [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions) ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.

This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for [dynamic routes](#dynamic-routes-without-loadingtsx) and [slow networks](#slow-networks).

## How navigation works

To understand how navigation works in Next.js, it helps to be familiar with the following concepts:

* [Server Rendering](#server-rendering)
* [Prefetching](#prefetching)
* [Streaming](#streaming)
* [Client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions)

### Server Rendering

In Next.js, [Layouts and Pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages.md) are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the [Server Component Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components.md#how-do-server-and-client-components-work-in-nextjs) is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering, based on *when* it happens:

* **Static Rendering (or Prerendering)** happens at build time or during [revalidation](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating.md) and the result is cached.
* **Dynamic Rendering** happens at request time in response to a client request.

The trade-off of server rendering is that the client must wait for the server to respond before the new route can be shown. Next.js addresses this delay by [prefetching](#prefetching) routes the user is likely to visit and performing [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions).

> **Good to know**: HTML is also generated for the initial visit.

### Prefetching

Prefetching is the process of loading a route in the background before the user navigates to it. This makes navigation between routes in your application feel instant, because by the time a user clicks on a link, the data to render the next route is already available client side.

Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link.md) when they enter the user's viewport.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:

* **Static Route**: the full route is prefetched.
* **Dynamic Route**: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if [`loading.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading.md) is present.

By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

![Server Rendering without Streaming](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png)

To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use [streaming](#streaming).

### Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.

For dynamic routes, it means they can be **partially prefetched**. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the `page.tsx` contents in a `<Suspense>` boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.

> **Good to know**: You can also use [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to create loading UI for nested components.

Benefits of `loading.tsx`:

* Immediate navigation and visual feedback for the user.
* Shared layouts remain interactive and navigation is interruptible.
* Improved Core Web Vitals: [TTFB](https://web.dev/articles/ttfb), [FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), and [TTI](https://web.dev/articles/tti).

To further improve the navigation experience, Next.js performs a [client-side transition](#client-side-transitions) with the `<Link>` component.

### Client-side transitions

Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.

Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the `<Link>` component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:

* Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
* Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.

Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps *feel* like client-rendered apps. And when paired with [prefetching](#prefetching) and [streaming](#streaming), it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.

## What can make transitions slow?

These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still *feel* slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

### Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`

When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

> **Good to know**: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See [`devIndicators`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators.md) for more information.

### Dynamic segments without `generateStaticParams`

If a [dynamic segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes.md) could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params.md), the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.

Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding `generateStaticParams`:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

### Slow networks

On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the `loading.js` fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.

To improve perceived performance, you can use the [`useLinkStatus` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status.md) to show immediate feedback while the transition is in progress.

```tsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

You can "debounce" the hint by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay. See the [`useLinkStatus` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status.md#gracefully-handling-fast-navigation) for a CSS example.

> **Good to know**: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example [here](https://github.com/vercel/react-transition-progress).

### Disabling prefetching

You can opt out of prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false` on the `<Link>` component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).

```tsx
<Link prefetch={false} href="/blog">
  Blog
</Link>
```

However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:

* **Static routes** will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.
* **Dynamic routes** will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.

To reduce resource usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more *likely* to visit, rather than all links in the viewport.

```tsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.js" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({ href, children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

### Hydration not completed

`<Link>` is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.

React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:

* Using the [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling.md#analyzing-javascript-bundles) plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.
* Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components.md) docs for guidance.

## Examples

### Native History API

Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname.md) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params.md).

#### `window.history.pushState`

Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### `window.history.replaceState`

Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale: string) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.js" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}

* [Prefetching](#prefetching)
* [Streaming](#streaming)
* [Client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions)

### Server Rendering

In Next.js, [Layouts and Pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages.md) are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the [Server Component Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components.md#how-do-server-and-client-components-work-in-nextjs) is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering, based on *when* it happens:

Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link.md) when they enter the user's viewport.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>

        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>

}
```

How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:

* **Static Route**: the full route is prefetched.
* **Dynamic Route**: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if [`loading.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading.md) is present.

By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

![Server Rendering without Streaming](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png)

To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use [streaming](#streaming).

### Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.

For dynamic routes, it means they can be **partially prefetched**. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.

}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.js" switcher

  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the `page.tsx` contents in a `<Suspense>` boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.

### Client-side transitions

Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.

Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the `<Link>` component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:

* Keeping any shared layouts and UI.

## What can make transitions slow?

These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still *feel* slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

### Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`

When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {

```

> **Good to know**: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See [`devIndicators`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators.md) for more information.

### Dynamic segments without `generateStaticParams`

If a [dynamic segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes.md) could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params.md), the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.

Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding `generateStaticParams`:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}

export default async function Page({
  params,

  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

### Slow networks

On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the `loading.js` fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.

To improve perceived performance, you can use the [`useLinkStatus` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status.md) to show immediate feedback while the transition is in progress.

```tsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

You can "debounce" the hint by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay. See the [`useLinkStatus` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status.md#gracefully-handling-fast-navigation) for a CSS example.

> **Good to know**: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example [here](https://github.com/vercel/react-transition-progress).

### Disabling prefetching

You can opt out of prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false` on the `<Link>` component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).

```tsx
<Link prefetch={false} href="/blog">
  Blog
</Link>
```

However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:

* **Static routes** will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.
* **Dynamic routes** will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.

To reduce resource usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more *likely* to visit, rather than all links in the viewport.

```tsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.js" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({ href, children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

### Hydration not completed

`<Link>` is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.

React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:

* Using the [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling.md#analyzing-javascript-bundles) plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.
* Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components.md) docs for guidance.

## Examples

### Native History API

Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname.md) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params.md).

#### `window.history.pushState`

Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### `window.history.replaceState`

Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale: string) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.js" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}

# Fetching Data
@doc-version: 16.0.1


This page will walk you through how you can fetch data in [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components.md), and how to [stream](#streaming) components that depend on data.

## Fetching data

### Server Components

You can fetch data in Server Components using any asynchronous I/O, such as:

1. The [`fetch` API](#with-the-fetch-api)
2. An [ORM or database](#with-an-orm-or-database)
3. Reading from the filesystem using Node.js APIs like `fs`

#### With the `fetch` API

To fetch data with the `fetch` API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the `fetch` call. For example:

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
  const posts = await data.json()
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
  const posts = await data.json()
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:**
>
> * `fetch` responses are not cached by default. However, Next.js will [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#static-rendering) the route and the output will be cached for improved performance. If you'd like to opt into [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#dynamic-rendering), use the `{ cache: 'no-store' }` option. See the [`fetch` API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch.md).
> * During development, you can log `fetch` calls for better visibility and debugging. See the [`logging` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/logging.md).

#### With an ORM or database

Since Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. Turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the call:

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
import { db, posts } from '@/lib/db'

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await db.select().from(posts)
  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
import { db, posts } from '@/lib/db'

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await db.select().from(posts)
  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Client Components

There are two ways to fetch data in Client Components, using:

1. React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)
2. A community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

#### Streaming data with the `use` hook

You can use React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) to [stream](#streaming) data from the server to client. Start by fetching data in your Server component, and pass the promise to your Client Component as prop:

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
import Posts from '@/app/ui/posts'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  // Don't await the data fetching function
  const posts = getPosts()

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
import Posts from '@/app/ui/posts'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  // Don't await the data fetching function
  const posts = getPosts()

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Then, in your Client Component, use the `use` hook to read the promise:

```tsx filename="app/ui/posts.tsx" switcher
'use client'
import { use } from 'react'

export default function Posts({
  posts,
}: {
  posts: Promise<{ id: string; title: string }[]>
}) {
  const allPosts = use(posts)

  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/posts.js" switcher
'use client'
import { use } from 'react'

export default function Posts({ posts }) {
  const allPosts = use(posts)

  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

In the example above, the `<Posts>` component is wrapped in a [`<Suspense>` boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). This means the fallback will be shown while the promise is being resolved. Learn more about [streaming](#streaming).

#### Community libraries

You can use a community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to fetch data in Client Components. These libraries have their own semantics for caching, streaming, and other features. For example, with SWR:

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
'use client'
import useSWR from 'swr'

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())

export default function BlogPage() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    'https://api.vercel.app/blog',
    fetcher
  )

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post: { id: string; title: string }) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
'use client'

import useSWR from 'swr'

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())

export default function BlogPage() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    'https://api.vercel.app/blog',
    fetcher
  )

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

## Deduplicate requests and cache data

One way to deduplicate `fetch` requests is with [request memoization](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#request-memoization). With this mechanism, `fetch` calls using `GET` or `HEAD` with the same URL and options in a single render pass are combined into one request. This happens automatically, and you can [opt out](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#opting-out) by passing an Abort signal to `fetch`.

Request memoization is scoped to the lifetime of a request.

You can also deduplicate `fetch` requests by using Next.js’ [Data Cache](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#data-cache), for example by setting `cache: 'force-cache'` in your `fetch` options.

Data Cache allows sharing data across the current render pass and incoming requests.

If you are *not* using `fetch`, and instead using an ORM or database directly, you can wrap your data access with the [React `cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) function.

```tsx filename="app/lib/data.ts" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import { db, posts, eq } from '@/lib/db'

export const getPost = cache(async (id: string) => {
  const post = await db.query.posts.findFirst({
    where: eq(posts.id, parseInt(id)),
  })
})
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/data.js" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import { db, posts, eq } from '@/lib/db'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export const getPost = cache(async (id) => {
  const post = await db.query.posts.findFirst({
    where: eq(posts.id, parseInt(id)),
  })
})
```

## Streaming

> **Warning:** The content below assumes the [`cacheComponents` config option](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents.md) is enabled in your application. The flag was introduced in Next.js 15 canary.

When you fetch data in Server Components, the data is fetched and rendered on the server for each request. If you have any slow data requests, the whole route will be blocked from rendering until all the data is fetched.

To improve the initial load time and user experience, you can use streaming to break up the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

There are two ways you can leverage streaming in your application:

1. Wrapping a page with a [`loading.js` file](#with-loadingjs)
2. Wrapping a component with [`<Suspense>`](#with-suspense)

### With `loading.js`

You can create a `loading.js` file in the same folder as your page to stream the **entire page** while the data is being fetched. For example, to stream `app/blog/page.js`, add the file inside the `app/blog` folder.

![Blog folder structure with loading.js file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Define the Loading UI here
  return <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Define the Loading UI here
  return <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

On navigation, the user will immediately see the layout and a [loading state](#creating-meaningful-loading-states) while the page is being rendered. The new content will then be automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

![Loading UI](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-ui.png)

Behind-the-scenes, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`, and will automatically wrap the `page.js` file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

![loading.js overview](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-overview.png)

This approach works well for route segments (layouts and pages), but for more granular streaming, you can use `<Suspense>`.

### With `<Suspense>`

`<Suspense>` allows you to be more granular about what parts of the page to stream. For example, you can immediately show any page content that falls outside of the `<Suspense>` boundary, and stream in the list of blog posts inside the boundary.

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import BlogList from '@/components/BlogList'
import BlogListSkeleton from '@/components/BlogListSkeleton'

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This content will be sent to the client immediately */}
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to the Blog</h1>
        <p>Read the latest posts below.</p>
      </header>
      <main>
        {/* If there's any dynamic content inside this boundary, it will be streamed in */}
        <Suspense fallback={<BlogListSkeleton />}>
          <BlogList />
        </Suspense>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import BlogList from '@/components/BlogList'
import BlogListSkeleton from '@/components/BlogListSkeleton'

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This content will be sent to the client immediately */}
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to the Blog</h1>
        <p>Read the latest posts below.</p>
      </header>
      <main>
        {/* If there's any dynamic content inside this boundary, it will be streamed in */}
        <Suspense fallback={<BlogListSkeleton />}>
          <BlogList />
        </Suspense>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Creating meaningful loading states

An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately to the user after navigation. For the best user experience, we recommend designing loading states that are meaningful and help users understand the app is responding. For example, you can use skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc.

In development, you can preview and inspect the loading state of your components using the [React Devtools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).

## Examples

### Sequential data fetching

Sequential data fetching happens when one request depends on data from another.

For example, `<Playlists>` can only fetch data after `<Artist>` completes because it needs the `artistID`:

```tsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ username: string }>
}) {
  const { username } = await params
  // Get artist information
  const artist = await getArtist(username)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

async function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {
  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)

  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.js" switcher
export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { username } = await params
  // Get artist information
  const artist = await getArtist(username)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

async function Playlists({ artistID }) {
  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)

  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

In this example, `<Suspense>` allows the playlists to stream in after the artist data loads. However, the page still waits for the artist data before displaying anything. To prevent this, you can wrap the entire page component in a `<Suspense>` boundary (for example, using a [`loading.js` file](#with-loadingjs)) to show a loading state immediately.

Ensure your data source can resolve the first request quickly, as it blocks everything else. If you can't optimize the request further, consider [caching](#deduplicate-requests-and-cache-data) the result if the data changes infrequently.

### Parallel data fetching

Parallel data fetching happens when data requests in a route are eagerly initiated and start at the same time.

By default, [layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages.md) are rendered in parallel. So each segment starts fetching data as soon as possible.

However, within *any* component, multiple `async`/`await` requests can still be sequential if placed after the other. For example, `getAlbums` will be blocked until `getArtist` is resolved:

```tsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.tsx" switcher
import { getArtist, getAlbums } from '@/app/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  // These requests will be sequential
  const { username } = await params
  const artist = await getArtist(username)
  const albums = await getAlbums(username)
  return <div>{artist.name}</div>
}
```

Start multiple requests by calling `fetch`, then await them with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all). Requests begin as soon as `fetch` is called.

```tsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.tsx" highlight={3,8,23} switcher
import Albums from './albums'

async function getArtist(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)
  return res.json()
}

async function getAlbums(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ username: string }>
}) {
  const { username } = await params

  // Initiate requests
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)

  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Albums list={albums} />
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/artist/[username]/page.js" highlight={3,8,19} switcher
import Albums from './albums'

async function getArtist(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)
  return res.json()
}

async function getAlbums(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { username } = await params

  // Initiate requests
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)

  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Albums list={albums} />
    </>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:** If one request fails when using `Promise.all`, the entire operation will fail. To handle this, you can use the [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) method instead.

### Preloading data

You can preload data by creating an utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests. `<Item>` conditionally renders based on the `checkIsAvailable()` function.

You can call `preload()` before `checkIsAvailable()` to eagerly initiate `<Item/>` data dependencies. By the time `<Item/>` is rendered, its data has already been fetched.

```tsx filename="app/item/[id]/page.tsx" switcher
import { getItem, checkIsAvailable } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  // starting loading item data
  preload(id)
  // perform another asynchronous task
  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()

  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null
}

const preload = (id: string) => {
  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
  void getItem(id)
}

export async function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const result = await getItem(id)
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/item/[id]/page.js" switcher
import { getItem, checkIsAvailable } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { id } = await params
  // starting loading item data
  preload(id)
  // perform another asynchronous task
  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()

  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null
}

const preload = (id) => {
  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
  void getItem(id)
}

export async function Item({ id }) {
  const result = await getItem(id)
  // ...
```

Additionally, you can use React's [`cache` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) and the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) to create a reusable utility function. This approach allows you to cache the data fetching function and ensure that it's only executed on the server.

```ts filename="utils/get-item.ts" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import 'server-only'
import { getItem } from '@/lib/data'

export const preload = (id: string) => {
  void getItem(id)
}

export const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {
  // ...
})
```

```js filename="utils/get-item.js" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import 'server-only'
import { getItem } from '@/lib/data'

export const preload = (id) => {
  void getItem(id)
}

export const getItem = cache(async (id) => {
  // ...
})
```

# Server and Client Components
@doc-version: 16.0.1


By default, layouts and pages are [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), which lets you fetch data and render parts of your UI on the server, optionally cache the result, and stream it to the client. When you need interactivity or browser APIs, you can use [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to layer in functionality.

This page explains how Server and Client Components work in Next.js and when to use them, with examples of how to compose them together in your application.

## When to use Server and Client Components?

The client and server environments have different capabilities. Server and Client components allow you to run logic in each environment depending on your use case.

Use **Client Components** when you need:

* [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) and [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events). E.g. `onClick`, `onChange`.
* [Lifecycle logic](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects). E.g. `useEffect`.
* Browser-only APIs. E.g. `localStorage`, `window`, `Navigator.geolocation`, etc.
* [Custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

Use **Server Components** when you need:

* Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
* Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.
* Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
* Improve the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/), and stream content progressively to the client.

For example, the `<Page>` component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the `<LikeButton>` which handles client-side interactivity.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

## How do Server and Client Components work in Next.js?

### On the server

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments ([layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages.md)):

* **Server Components** are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
* **Client Components** and the RSC Payload are used to [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching.md#rendering-strategies) HTML.

> **What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?**
>
> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:
>
> * The rendered result of Server Components
> * Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
> * Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component

### On the client (first load)

Then, on the client:

1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

> **What is hydration?**
>
> Hydration is React's process for attaching [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.

### Subsequent Navigations

On subsequent navigations:

* The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
* **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.

## Examples

### Using Client Components

You can create a Client Component by adding the [`"use client"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) directive at the top of the file, above your imports.

```tsx filename="app/ui/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`"use client"` is used to declare a **boundary** between the Server and Client module graphs (trees).

Once a file is marked with `"use client"`, **all its imports and child components are considered part of the client bundle**. This means you don't need to add the directive to every component that is intended for the client.

### Reducing JS bundle size

To reduce the size of your client JavaScript bundles, add `'use client'` to specific interactive components instead of marking large parts of your UI as Client Components.

For example, the `<Layout>` component contains mostly static elements like a logo and navigation links, but includes an interactive search bar. `<Search />` is interactive and needs to be a Client Component, however, the rest of the layout can remain a Server Component.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/search.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/search.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

### Passing data from Server to Client Components

You can pass data from Server Components to Client Components using props.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,7} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,7} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can stream data from a Server Component to a Client Component with the [`use` Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use). See an [example](/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data.md#streaming-data-with-the-use-hook).

> **Good to know**: Props passed to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.

### Interleaving Server and Client Components

You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component. This allows you to visually nest server-rendered UI within Client components.

A common pattern is to use `children` to create a *slot* in a `<ClientComponent>`. For example, a `<Cart>` component that fetches data on the server, inside a `<Modal>` component that uses client state to toggle visibility.

```tsx filename="app/ui/modal.tsx" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/modal.js" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

Then, in a parent Server Component (e.g.`<Page>`), you can pass a `<Cart>` as the child of the `<Modal>`:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"  highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

In this pattern, all Server Components will be rendered on the server ahead of time, including those as props. The resulting RSC payload will contain references of where Client Components should be rendered within the component tree.

### Context providers

[React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is commonly used to share global state like the current theme. However, React context is not supported in Server Components.

To use context, create a Client Component that accepts `children`:

```tsx filename="app/theme-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/theme-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

Then, import it into a Server Component (e.g. `layout`):

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider, and all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.

> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.

### Third-party components

When using a third-party component that relies on client-only features, you can wrap it in a Client Component to ensure it works as expected.

For example, the `<Carousel />` can be imported from the `acme-carousel` package. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `"use client"` directive.

If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:

```tsx filename="app/gallery.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/gallery.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error. This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.

To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:

```tsx filename="app/carousel.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

```jsx filename="app/carousel.js" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

> **Advice for Library Authors**
>
> If you’re building a component library, add the `"use client"` directive to entry points that rely on client-only features. This lets your users import components into Server Components without needing to create wrappers.
>
> It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `"use client"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `"use client"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.

### Preventing environment poisoning

JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules. This means it's possible to accidentally import server-only code into the client. For example, consider the following function:

```ts filename="lib/data.ts" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

```js filename="lib/data.js" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

This function contains an `API_KEY` that should never be exposed to the client.

In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are included in the client bundle. If variables are not prefixed, Next.js replaces them with an empty string.

As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected.

To prevent accidental usage in Client Components, you can use the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only).

Then, import the package into a file that contains server-only code:

```js filename="lib/data.js"
import 'server-only'

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

Now, if you try to import the module into a Client Component, there will be a build-time error.

The corresponding [`client-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-only) can be used to mark modules that contain client-only logic like code that accesses the `window` object.

In Next.js, installing `server-only` or `client-only` is **optional**. However, if your linting rules flag extraneous dependencies, you may install them to avoid issues.

```bash package="npm"
npm install server-only
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add server-only
```

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add server-only
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add server-only
```

Next.js handles `server-only` and `client-only` imports internally to provide clearer error messages when a module is used in the wrong environment. The contents of these packages from NPM are not used by Next.js.

Next.js also provides its own type declarations for `server-only` and `client-only`, for TypeScript configurations where [`noUncheckedSideEffectImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports) is active.
